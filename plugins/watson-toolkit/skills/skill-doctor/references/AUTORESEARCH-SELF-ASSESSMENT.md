## Q1–Q14 Scoring (v1.5.0)

| # | Question | Answer | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| Q1 | Description as trigger conditions? | YES | Lists 5 specific use cases + NOT FOR list |
| Q2 | Gotchas section? | YES | Explicit Known Limitations & Gotchas section, 10 entries |
| Q3 | Progressive disclosure? | YES | references/reviewers/, 14-question-checklist, autoresearch, archive-template, prism-templates |
| Q4 | Avoids railroading? | YES | Phase gates are decision frameworks, not iron laws |
| Q5 | Config state correct? | N/A | No persistent state |
| Q6 | Scripts/helpers bundled? | YES | prism-setup.sh, prism-summary.sh |
| Q7 | Output scoreable? | YES | Before/after score table; PRISM verdict table |
| Q8 | 9-category fit? | YES | Code Quality & Review |
| Q9 | Not over-triggered? | YES | Very specific triggers |
| Q10 | Examples present? | YES | Worked example (build-feature Phase 1→6) |
| Q11 | Dependencies documented? | YES | Full Dependencies section |
| Q12 | Verification hooks? | YES | Phase 5 explicit |
| Q13 | Empirical testing? | PARTIAL | 6 skills run this session; consistent results, no formal output log yet |
| Q14 | Observability? | PARTIAL | sub-agent-complete.sh on Phase 6 + prism-summary.sh on review completion; no per-run quality log |

**Score:** 12/14

## Worked Example — build-feature Audit (Phase 1→6)

| Phase | Action | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| P1: Diagnose | Read SKILL.md (528 lines), `grep "^## "`, `ls references/` | Score: 7/12. Gaps: broken spawn params, no complexity gate, broken refs, stale doc names |
| P2: PRISM R1 | 6 agents in parallel, DA blind | All APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS. Integration found invalid `model=` in 6 spawn calls. Blast found 11 stale docs. |
| P3: Prescribe | Tier 1: broken spawn syntax (Integration, 2 reviewers); Tier 2: complexity gate, broken refs | 7 conditions total |
| P4: Fix | Fixed spawn params, added Complexity Gate, removed broken git-worktrees refs, added completion emit, updated 5 docs | 528 lines → extracted spawn-templates.md → 350 core lines |
| P5: Verify | `grep -E "model=\|max_depth="` → 0 hits. `ls references/` → spawn-templates.md present. | Score: 10/12 ✅ |
| P6: Archive | Written to `analysis/prism/archive/build-feature/2026-03-18-review.md` | SKILL-HEALTH-SCORES.md updated |

## Mutation Candidates (updated 2026-03-19)

From 14-skill improvement session — three highest-yield additions:

1. **Phase 0: Upstream research step** — Before PRISMing any skill, check `obra/superpowers` for a richer upstream version. `brainstorming` went 3→11/14 because upstream had a spec review loop and hard gates missing locally. Add as a pre-flight step: `curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/skills/{SKILL_NAME}/SKILL.md" | wc -l`. 2-minute check, consistently high yield.

2. **Run-log aggregation bus event** — After Phase 6 archive, emit a bus event including skill name + new score. A future weekly cron can aggregate these into a "skills needing re-audit" queue. Currently skill-doctor archives results but nothing reads them automatically. The 6-question scorecards are in every improved skill — the feedback loop closes when Watson logs them after real runs and aggregates weekly.

3. **Watson-specific gotcha prompt** — The highest-value gotchas in every skill referenced real Jeremy communication patterns and trust consequences (e.g., "Jeremy has said 'I don't believe you'" in verification-before-completion). skill-doctor should prompt for Watson-context gotchas explicitly during Phase 4: *"What would make Jeremy say 'I don't believe you' or 'just do it' here?"*

## Improvement Log

| Date | Version | Change | Score |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| 2026-03-18 | v1.0 | Initial creation, synthesized from full-day improvement work on 3 skills | 10/12 |
| 2026-03-18 | v1.1 | PRISM R1: security guards (injection, secrets, trust model), fast-path checklist, worked example, registry entries | 10/12 |
| 2026-03-18 | v1.2 | Bash orchestrator (prism.sh + review-common.sh): timeout handling, parallel fan-out, auto path detection. Reviewer templates split to references/reviewers/ | 10/12 |
| 2026-03-18 | v1.3 | Root cause fix: replaced `openclaw agent --local` (session-lock contention) with `sessions_spawn` for LLM fan-out. Bash now handles only deterministic scaffolding. prism.sh split into prism-setup.sh + prism-summary.sh. review-common.sh v2.0 | 10/12 |
| 2026-03-18 | v1.4 | PRISM dogfood (skill-doctor on skill-doctor): added Q13+Q14 to checklist, Phase 3.5 gate, Phase 6b stalled detection, high-traffic definition, consensus resolution rules, extracted autoresearch self-assessment to references/ | 10/12 |
| 2026-03-18 | v1.5.0 | Accuracy pass (2-agent review): fixed reviewer write targets (*-raw.txt), canonicalized 14-question checklist (renamed file, updated all refs + thresholds), fixed DA inject bug (Step 2 no longer injects DA_FINDINGS), removed stale review-common.sh from live deps, clarified Round 2 DA behavior, prism-templates.md marked legacy. GA status. | 12/14 |
| 2026-03-19 | v1.7.0 | 9-reviewer PRISM (Prior Brief Compiler + Contrarian + Synthesis Agent from cogpros/prism-orchestrator); complete-code-review 12-fix pass; all blockers resolved | 12/14 |
| 2026-03-19 | — | 3 new mutation candidates logged from 14-skill improvement session | 12/14 |
